    RL
        Reinforcment Learning. A machine learning method to learn policies trough
        interaction with an environment.

    SARL
        Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning. A reinforcement learning setting where a
        single agent interacts with an environment to learn an optimal policy.

    MARL
        Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. A reinforcement learning setting where
        multiple agents interact with an environment to learn optimal policies. In this 
        setting, agents typically share a policy and learn collaboratively.

    SB3
        Stable Baselines3. A popular open-source library for RL algorithms, built on top
        of PyTorch, providing implementations of various RL methods for easy 
        experimentation and benchmarking.

    AFC
        Active Flow Control. The use of actuators to manipulate a fluid flow in order to
        achieve a desired outcome, such as drag reduction or lift enhancement.

    RBC
        Rayleigh-Bénard Convection. A type of natural convection that occurs in a fluid
        layer heated from below and cooled from above, leading to the formation of
        convection cells.

    TCF
        Turbulent Channel Flow. A canonical flow configuration used to study turbulence
        in wall-bounded flows, characterized by a fluid flowing between two parallel
        plates.

    PPO
        Proximal Policy Optimization. A policy gradient method that improves learning
        stability by using a clipped surrogate objective, preventing excessive policy
        updates and ensuring reliable performance.

    SAC 
        Soft Actor-Critic. An off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that maximizes
        both expected reward and entropy, encouraging robust exploration and sample 
        efficiency.
